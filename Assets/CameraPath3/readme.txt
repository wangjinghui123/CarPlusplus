QUICKSTART:
------------------------------------------------------

Once you have installed Camera Path you should be able to see the Camera Path 3 directory in your project view.
To start creating your new animation path, click on GameObject > Create New Camera Path
This will place a new animation path in the scene with the animator and path components attached.

------------------------------------------------------
BASIC OVERVIEW:
------------------------------------------------------

There are two components in a Camera Path object. 
The Main Camera Path which allows you to create and edit the path.
The Camera Path Animator which controls how the path behaves in your game.

In the Camera Path component we have the following modes
Path Points - these define where the path goes.
Control Points - only used in Bezier curves, these control the shape of the curves.
FOV - is used to control the Field of View of the Camera during the animation.
Speed - is used to control the speed of the animation over the curve.
Delay - you can add points to delay the animation by specific time periods.
Ease Curves - Control the ease of the animation speed at specific stop points on the animation.
Events - add events to the path that can either call functions in other objects, or broadcast events.
Orientations - Control the orientation of the camera through the path, only used in the Custom animation mode.
Tilts - control the camera tilt through the path used in follow path animation modes
