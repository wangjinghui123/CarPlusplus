Brand new GUI system written making it easier to create your animation
New control point system - You can now split control points for more control over the curves
Interpolation options - Hermite, Smooth Step, Linear and Not Interpolated join Bezier interpolation for curve calculations
Event Points - Specify events that either broadcast C# events or call a monobehaviour method (Send Message)
Speed Points - You can now control the speed of your animtion within Camera Path natively
